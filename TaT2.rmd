# What we found

The below is based on `r runs_count` runs of each scenario.

```{R numbers_table_compare, echo = FALSE}
k <- data.frame(
"TaT" = c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11),
"Infections_test" = c(mean(t2$Infections), mean(t3$Infections), mean(t4$Infections), mean(t5$Infections), mean(t6$Infections), mean(t7$Infections), mean(t8$Infections), mean(t9$Infections), mean(t10$Infections), mean(t11$Infections)),
"Infections_no_test" = c(mean(t2n$Infections), mean(t3n$Infections), mean(t4n$Infections), mean(t5n$Infections), mean(t6n$Infections), mean(t7n$Infections), mean(t8n$Infections), mean(t9n$Infections), mean(t10n$Infections), mean(t11n$Infections)),
"Dead_test" = c(mean(t2$Dead), mean(t3$Dead), mean(t4$Dead), mean(t5$Dead), mean(t6$Dead), mean(t7$Dead), mean(t8$Dead), mean(t9$Dead), mean(t10$Dead), mean(t11$Dead)),
"Dead_no_test" = c(mean(t2n$Dead), mean(t3n$Dead), mean(t4n$Dead), mean(t5n$Dead), mean(t6n$Dead), mean(t7n$Dead), mean(t8n$Dead), mean(t9n$Dead), mean(t10n$Dead), mean(t11n$Dead)),
"Tests_test" = c(mean(t2$Tests), mean(t3$Tests), mean(t4$Tests), mean(t5$Tests), mean(t6$Tests), mean(t7$Tests), mean(t8$Tests), mean(t9$Tests), mean(t10$Tests), mean(t11$Tests)),
"Tests_no_test" = c(mean(t2n$Tests), mean(t3n$Tests), mean(t4n$Tests), mean(t5n$Tests), mean(t6n$Tests), mean(t7n$Tests), mean(t8n$Tests), mean(t9n$Tests), mean(t10n$Tests), mean(t11n$Tests)))

```


# Plotting

This plot shows how total infections rise with longer TaTs, in addition to showing the difference made by whether or not contacts are tested. (The code for this plot  is in serious need of improvement. - do it for the team Dr Grebe.)

```{R TaT_infections, echo = FALSE}
p <- ggplot(data = k) +
geom_bar(aes(x = TaT, y = Infections_no_test), stat="identity", color="darkblue", fill="darkblue") +
geom_bar(aes(x = TaT, y = Infections_test), stat="identity", color="orange", fill="orange") +
xlim(2, 11) +
ylim(0, 6000) +
xlab("TaT") +
ylab("Infections (with and without testing of contacts)") 
show(p)
```

The below is the difference in total infections between Tat=2 and TaT =3, between Tat=3 and Tact = 4, and so on.
```{R changes_infections_by_TaT, echo = FALSE}
with_test <- c(0, 0)
without_test <- c(0, 0)
m <- length(k$TaT) - 1
for (i in 1:m) {
with_test[i] <- round(k[i+1, 2] - k [i, 2]) 
}

for (i in 1:m) {
without_test[i] <- round(k[i+1, 3] - k [i, 3]) 
}
l <- rbind(with_test, without_test)
htmlTable(l)
```
